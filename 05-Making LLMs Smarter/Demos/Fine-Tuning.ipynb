    "# Fine-Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning is the process of expanding an LLM's knowledge base by training an existing model with additional samples at a reduced learning rate. The goal is to make the LLM \"smarter\" without impacting the knowledge instilled by the original training. Many foundation models from vendors such as OpenAI, Google, and Meta support fine-tuning. OpenAI models can be fine-tuned using the [fine-tuning API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning), or they can be fine-tuned using the [fine-tuning dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/finetune). Let's demonstrate by fine-tuning `GPT-4o-mini` to generate SQL queries for a database. We'll use Microsoft's Northwind database, but we'll call it the \"Wintellect\" database so the LLM can't use anything it learned about Northwind during its training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by defining a function that uses `GPT-4o` to generate SQL queries for a series of questions. Later, we'll use these queries and the questions they were generated from to fine-tune `gpt-4o-mini`. The prompt here includes the database schema definition:"
