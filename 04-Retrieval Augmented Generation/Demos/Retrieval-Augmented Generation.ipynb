    "# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "The #1 use case for Large Language Models (LLMs) today is putting them over internal documents to make information in those documents easily discoverable. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique that allows LLMs to work with any number of documents of any size. LLMs limit how much text can be input to them in a single call. RAG involves dividing documents into \"chunks\" of (typically) a few hundred words each and generating an embedding vector for each chunk. To answer a question, you generate an embedding vector from the question, identify the *n* most similar embedding vectors, and provide the corresponding chunks of text to the LLM. To improve results, you can use a *reranker* to determine which chunks are the most relevant. Let's demonstrate with a CSV file containing more than 8,000 reviews of BMWs.\n",

      "Review: We picked this car as a CPO from a BMW dealer. No problems to date. Relatively decent handling for the type car, and just the right size and height. We stayed away from the newer version to avoid a Mini based front wheel platform derived car as opposed to a BMW based one. The new 2018 X1 also features a flimsy cloth covering under the moonroof that I can see ripping quickly. If you want a X1 like this may I suggest springing for the upgraded interior. Base level seating has poor lateral support and are unacceptable. Base halogen headlights are unacceptable and should be avoided. My 3 series coupe has xenons which are \"light years\" better. Sorry!:-) Base sound system is \"media-ocre\" at best. I don't understand the need for moonroofs on BMWs, and wish they would apportion the monies elsewhere and delete them. Acceleration with the 240 hp is considerably better than you would expect for a 4 cyl. It feels like a 6! Braking is only adequate , but some experts blame this on the stock tires rather than the car. I also would like a manual transmission X1 like they have in other countries! When you're shopping, seek out a well optioned example only! A base car sporting only a badge is bad form indeed.\n",

It however came with the crappiest quality materials I have seen in German cars, and it because the hard plastics were constantly expanding and rubbing, rattles/creaks were always present. The run flats combined with M suspension did not help either. Oh, and I purchased this vehicle at 45k and 2 years later the value was at 14k so its two year depreciation was @ 68% which is a little steep even for a BMW.\n",

      "Review: Our 2007 BMW 328i (3.0 litre I6) is one of the best cars out there! The 3.0 litre I6 hasplenty power! The 230 horses has gotten us to 105 EASILY! The only problem we've had so far is an oil leak...that costs about 1k to fix...but its worth having the car! I'm not a huge fan of the fake wood on the dash and panels but whatever. I'm actually kind of glad we dont have iDrive because i've heard up until 2009 models, iDrive has sucked. The BMW professional sound system is great! Rear seat room is ok...front seats are comfortable enough. Luckily German cars have a lot of pop-on parts. One of the coolest features is the BMW flashlight in the glove compartment! This car is great! We bought it for 8k, but it was really priced at 14k. We bought it in December of 2015. But resale value on BMWs is horrible. This car is GREAT!\n",

      "Review: Purchased used with 33,000 miles. This is my second, and how disappointed I am. Way too many problems, with everything from the windows to the braking system, to the engine and etc. 14 trips to the dealer for repairs since 10/2003. I would never buy another, and am looking into an Audi or Mercedes. I do have to admit the the MPG is awesome, at times I have clocked 40+. BMW is not what it used to be!! BMW really needs to work on the reliability. This car is way too expensive to maintain!\n",

      "Review: After owning this car for over 5 years I can honestly say it is the most unreliable & expensive to repair vehicle I've ever had. Everything that could go wrong has and at a huge cost to repair. Anyone thinking of buying one of these cars should think again! I've endured complete brake replacements every 15K miles, had to replace almost the entire front suspension (worn ball joints can not be replaced by themselves), the mass air flow sensor, all 6 ignition coils, cam shaft sensor and a whole host of other \"should be reliable\" electronic components have failed. If someone gives you one of these cars - sell it!\n",

Some owners report their BMWs as reliable and long-lasting, whereas others express dissatisfaction with frequent mechanical issues and time-consuming repairs. There seems to be a consensus that while BMWs offer excellent driving dynamics and build quality, they can be expensive to maintain and repair. Common issues noted include high costs of parts and maintenance, electronic component failures, and expensive repair bills, especially as the vehicles age. Hence, BMWs are generally considered to be expensive to work on."
